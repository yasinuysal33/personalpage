      After graduating from one of the best engineering universities in Turkey
      -Istanbul Technical University- I dedicated myself to public service and
      started to work in the Undersecretariat of Turkish Treasury as an expert.
      During my duties in this esteemed state agency, I always improved myself
      in programming languages as a hobby activity. After 8 years in my public
      official work, I thought public service is not a good way of my
      self-creation. I understood that it was only be achieved with creating
      something with my own power. That was my first step to programming world.
      And I quitted my job in the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
      <br />
      <br /> Since 2016, I found my own way. I improved myself in various web
      applications. In the beginning, I worked in WordPress applications, but
      later I tried to find a far more freedom in creating something on web.
      With advices of my friends I stepped in the React world in 2018 and now
      I'm really happy to be a part of this fantastic world. I really found
      myself here, and enjoyed every keystroke during my journey to improve
      myself. Now I feel very comfortable in React, Nextjs, TS, HTML, CSS,
      TailwindCSS, MaterialUI, Google Services, and in various areas.
