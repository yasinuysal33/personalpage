      After graduating from one of the best engineering universities in Turkey
      -Istanbul Technical University- I dedicetad my self to public service and
      started to work in the Undersecretariat of Turkish Treasury as an expert.
      During my duties in this esteemed state agency, I always improved myself
      in programming languges a hobby activity. After 8 years in my public
      official work, I thougt public service is not a good way of my self
      creation. I understood that it was only be achieved with creating
      something with my own power. That was my first step to programming world.
      And I quited my job in the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
      <br />
      <br /> Since 2016, I found my own way. I improved my self in various web
      applications. In the beginning, I worked in Wordpress applciations, but
      later I seeked a far more freedom in creating someting on web. With
      advices of my friends I stepped in the React world in 2018 and now I'm
      really happy to be a part of this fantastic world. I really found myself
      here, and enjoyed every keystroke during my journey to improve my self.
      Now I feel very comfortable in React, Nextjs, HTML, CSS, TS, Google
      Services, and in various areas.
